# DataStructures

This is a repository for my Data Structures projects.

Binary Trees - I compare AVL Trees and Splay Trees. They are implemented in Java along with graphs and tables for comparisons

Hash Tables - Linear Probing vs Chaining method. Implementation of HashTables is done in Java

Binary Decision Diagrams - the program accepts a random boolean expression as input and creates correct outputs for the expression and calculates the reduced form of the same expression
